 # Competitive Programming
 
 Hi there! in this repository I keep the competitive programming problems that I have solved and the main algorithms I have learned.

Competitive programming problems are classified according to their website (codeforces, SPOJ, UVA, leet code...). The code name is also the name of the problem, so searching for "Name of the Web Page" + "name of the problem" should be able to get the statement.
